# Project Revival
# Dennis Elmore (DKE85)
# A new incarnation of my portfolio site.

# 1.0
# Like so often happens the first iteration of my resume site was bad, all copies of it were lost a long time ago. 

# 2.0
# My first major portfolio site, I had the idea to do more with less, trying to make the most professional site I could utilizing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
# The reception was less than stellar, a jQuery/jQueryUI page was added per request, but this did little to add to the appeal.

# 3.0
# The second major rebuild was to pull out all the stops incorporating as much as I could to really show off what my actual skills were. 
# After getting pretty well started into having a very nice C#/.net page, I discovered my host site didn't offer .net page hosting. I didn't have the finances
#   to get the higher package for it or self host. So this was ultimately scrapped.

# 4.0 (Project Revival)
# So much technology has changed and evolved since 1.0, HTML5, CSS3, ES6, plus numerous standards. The site became horribly out-of-date and I had little time to maintain
#   it due to work, training/studying, ect. I realized I wanted to reprioritize my life, that also meant revitalizing my image and personal brand. As such, this 
#   new iteration of the site represents a piece of that.

# Build Status is currently a concept. I have a strong idea of where I want it to go and drawings, enough to lay ground work.

# The code style being utilized will be Standard

# Site will be built using Bootstrap 4, jQuery 3.3.1, jQueryUI 1.12.1, popper.js, SASS via Koala, npm, Git Hub, and Angular.
